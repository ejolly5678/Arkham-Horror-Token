# arkham-horror-token
 A generator for the card game Arkham Horror.

The template originally used is the angular seed template.
It can be found here: https://github.com/angular/angular-seed
I plan on changing a lot from it, but as this is my first real angular project,
I chose to start off with that.

This site is meant to be used with the card game Arkham horror.

Their method of randomly generating your role with a chaos token, isn't
truly random and is kind of annoying. Instead of having a bunch of tokens
in a bowl, I have created this website to randomly generate them based on the
game mode. I hope to be able to share this to others as well.

Currently doesn't really do much  yet, but I'm working on it.
Want to eventually get a URL for it and make it an actual website anyone can use,
but it's not at that point yet.

Here is a link to Arkham Horror

I have no rights at all to the game, I just enjoy it.
This is a fan made project and is currently incomplete
