# arkham-horror-token
 A generator for the card game arkham horror

The template originally used is the angular seed template.
It can be found here: https://github.com/angular/angular-seed
I plan on changing a lot from it, but as this is my first real angular project,
I chose to start off with that.

This site is meant to be used with the card game arkhem horror.

Their method of randomly generating your role with a choas token, isn't
truly random and is kind of annoying. Instead of having a bunch of tokens
in a bowl, I have created this website to randomly generate them based on the
game mode. I hope to be able to share this to others as well.

Currently in version 0.1 where it's a website but it doesn't do things correctly
yet
